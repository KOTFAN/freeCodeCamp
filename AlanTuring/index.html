                  Born in London on 23 June 1912.
                  Demonstrated extraordinary mathematical talent at a young age, solving advanced problems without
                  formal training.
                  Attended Sherborne School, where he often clashed with traditional teaching methods that undervalued
                  science.

               <div class="tribute-info__desitions">
                  Studied at Kings College, Cambridge, and later earned his PhD from Princeton University.
                  Developed fundamental concepts of what we now call “Turing machines,” laying the foundation for
                  theoretical computer science.

                  Joined Bletchley Park at the outbreak of World War II.
                  Led Hut 8, instrumental in deciphering the German Enigma machine.
                  Invented the “bombe,” greatly speeding up the breaking of German naval codes and helping shorten the
                  war.

                  Worked at the National Physical Laboratory, designing the Automatic Computing Engine (ACE), one of the
                  earliest computer blueprints.
                  Moved to the University of Manchester to develop software for pioneering computers.

                  Published “Computing Machinery and Intelligence,” introducing the Turing Test to define machine
                  “thinking.”
                  Explored morphogenesis in biology, predicting chemical processes that form patterns in living
                  organisms.

                  Prosecuted for homosexual acts in 1952 under British law; accepted hormone treatment instead of
                  prison.
                  Died on 7 June 1954 under circumstances officially ruled as suicide; some still question the verdict.

                  Posthumously recognized as the father of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence.
                  Officially pardoned in 2013 for his “gross indecency” conviction.
                  Honored on the Bank of England £50 note, unveiled on his birthday in 2021.
